# Decision record 6

# Upload a single csv at a time

## Status

Completed

## Context

Uploading survey results takes a long time.  It's on the order of 20-30 minutes per csv file.
## Decision

Instead of uploading all records each time, upload only a single csv file
## Consequences

There is a lot less time spent performing work that has already been done. This script, like the script to import all csvs, does not remove any responses.  It only adds responses that do not already exist and modifies the likert value to the one found in the csv if the value differs from the database.
