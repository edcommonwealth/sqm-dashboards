# Capture information about rejected survey item responses

## Status

Completed

## Context

The script to import survey item responses was previously silently rejecting values outside of the likert score range of 1-5.  This led to situations where the average scores on google sheets did not match the average likert score on the site.  The google sheets score was averaging invalid likert scores where the site was not.
## Decision

Now instead of silently rejecting invalid values we print any values we rejected.

## Consequences

This change should make it clearer when some data is being filtered from upload to the database
