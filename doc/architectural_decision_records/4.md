# Correct response rate and scores for response rate schools

## Status

Completed

## Context

Data for short-form schools gets incorrectly listed as insufficient data.  Short form surveys include fewer questions than the default surveys.  When calculating the response rate for a subcategory we divide the total number of survey item responses by the number of questions to get the average responses per question.  We were incorrectly dividing by a higher number of quesions than are on the short-form survey.

## Decision

The decision was made to take into account if a school took the short form or long form survey and display the response rate and score accordingly.  In order to keep track of which school took the short form surveys in which years, we created a new database table 'Surveys'.   We also marked which questions were on the short form survey to get the correct count of questions by which to divide the responses.

## Consequences

There is additional code complexity in performing the response rate and score calculations.
