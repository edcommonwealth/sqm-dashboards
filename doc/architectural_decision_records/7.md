# Intruduce concept of sufficiency for admin data items

## Status

Completed

## Context

The browse page contains accordions that inform the user if some data of missing data.  In the case of survey items, a response rate of less than 25 percent will mean no scores for that scale will be reflected in the gauge graph.  In the case of admin data, there is no such thing as response rate.  Data was either collected or not.  But we still want to inform the user that not all data was collected.  if some admin data was not collected, we still want to let the user know not all data is included.

## Decision

We inform users of insufficient data if, for a measure, any admin data items could not be collected.  If there are five admin data items for a measure, there must be a corresponding five admin data values in the database to be considered 'sufficient'.  Otherwise we inform the user of missing admin data on the browse page.

## Consequences

At the moment, the admin_data_presenter class only knows if a measure has sufficient admin data or not.  It does not know which admin data items lack corresponding values.   We are not yet informing the user which admin data values are missing. A later story will need to be written to correct this.
