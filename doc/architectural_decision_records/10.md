# Add unique Response ID to Boston csv files

## Status

Completed
## Context

Boston administered their own surveys for the 2018-19 school year.   Qualtrics usually assigns a unique response ID.  Boston did not include a unique ID for the responses.

## Decision

The response IDs for this year are just consecutive integers starting with 1.

## Consequences

Most response id's in the database are generated by qualtrics and look like:  R_24IvMAxf0EV3C69.  The boston response ids may look like a mistake since they could be as simple as '1'.  But we just needed an ID that would be unique in the database.
