# Decision record 3

# Change the response rate threshold from a static number to a response rate percentage

## Status

Completed

## Context

We do not show responses if there is insufficient data. We only show a graph if it's statistically meaningful. Previously, the minimum number of responses was set to 17 per teacher survey item and 196 per student survey item. This was calculated at the measure level.

## Decision

We have changed the minumim threshold to be a 25 percent response rate at the subcategory level.

## Consequences

This story, in combination with the story for marking short-form only schools, means that small population elementary schools will be able to see the responses visualized on the dashboard where before, that data would have been filtered out.
