# Decision record 3

# Change the response rate threshold from a static number to a response rate percentage

## Status

Completed

## Context

We do not show responses if there is insufficient data. We only show a graph if it's statistically meaningful. Previously, the minimum number of responses was set to 17 per teacher survey item and 196 per student survey item. This was calculated at the measure level.

## Decision

We have changed the minumim threshold to be a 25 percent response rate at the subcategory level.

## Consequences

This story, in combination with the story for marking short-form only schools, means that small population elementary schools will be able to see the responses visualized on the dashboard where before, that data would have been filtered out.

Calculating the response rate depends upon knowing the total possible number of students and teachers for a given year for a given school.  Without those numbers a response rate cannot be calculated.  Changing the response rate threshold from a static number to a response rate percentage has meant that for years where the response rate cannot be calculated, data is not shown; no graphs are visualized.  An additional story will need to be created to figure out how to handle showing information for years where the response rate cannot be calculated.
