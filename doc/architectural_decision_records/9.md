# Decision record 9

# Modify score calculations so that a survey item score of 0 is never included in the average

## Status

Completed

## Context

Some scores were artificially low because survey items that lacked survey item responses returned a score of 0.  0 did not represent the average likert_scores of survey item responses, only the lack of responses.  0 was incorrectly being averaged with other survey items and artificially dragging down the score.

## Decision

Survey item scores of 0 should be ignored and filtered out when performing score calculations.

## Consequences

Some average scores have increased.
