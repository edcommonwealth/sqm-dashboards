# Commit Type Guideline
  * build: changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: npm, pip, rg)
  * ci: changes to CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: format, lint, issue_templates)
  * docs: changes to the documentation only
  * feat: new feature for the user
  * fix: bug fix
  * perf: performance improvement
  * refactor: code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  * test: adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
  * chore: all the rest, including version bump for plugins
