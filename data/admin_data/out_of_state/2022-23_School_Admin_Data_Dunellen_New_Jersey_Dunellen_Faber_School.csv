"for all schools with a % teachers of color less than 5, they will receive a 1 on our Likert scale. We decided to set 5% as a ""floor"" because even in a school that is 100% white, there should still be teachers of color. If a school has greater than or equal to 5%, then the formula is: (% teachers of color/% students of color) * (4/0.25)",2022-23,50,,ratio,a-cure-i1,,,0.26,((benchmark - (number_of_students / raw score)) + benchmark)* 4 / benchmark),1
