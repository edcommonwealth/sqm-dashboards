Even if they pretend to be and something gets inputed to better the delivery of services that does not mean it will happen. My experience in meetings has been ruthless and I have had to fight for years for services. That experience was not collaborative or in the best interest of the student or us as caregivers. Once services were granted feeling my hopes for partnership and collaboration were soon diminished after years of poor follow through after meetings and in my child's day to day.",5,5,5,3,4,3,5,"the only time I have been contacted about my childs academic achievement is by absolutely stellar individual teachers who are willing to put in extra time, tutor at school, etc. Specific academic concerns and thoughts about potential issue or disability DO NOT HAPPEN. Years will go by without identifying a students academic needs that should have intervention. If they hop into an intervention you are lucky and that is where it ends. Any thoughts about an eval, possible IEP for academics come from parent identified concerns. BUT if concerns are behavioral or disruptive you will ALWAYS hear about them and more often if not every time they are looking for help and suggestions from parents on how and what to do with those children. In my opinion the school is completely inept at dealing with basic 101 behaviors ESPECIALLY when they are a result of a disability or lets say ADHD diagnosis.",4,4,4,This last years seems school events have picked up to close to if not pre-covid  normal practice. ,1,5,4,"My children do not like going to school. One child feels completely demoralized and has lost trust in some of the teachers and staff at school due to how they treat them, call them out, mis-represent situations, etc. My other child does not like school and this is likely due to this child finding academics in general hard and unenjoyable. On another note, there is a lot of punishment and collaborative/grade level consequences happening. I feel like school finds it easier to supervise and group everyone into new systems instead dealing with a small group of students that are unruly. Some of the characteristics of a school that have previously made Fowler fun for kids is reforming into regimented systems meant to prevent and identify unwanted behaviors instead of focusing on respect, shared community and efforts to value our spaces and people, etc.",5,5,5,3,"there are certain things that have happened that lead me to feel that I don't know that the school values my child's emotional well being. I believe that they would like to, but actions are something else. The teachers have maintained good communication with me...at my request when things are off with 1 of my children that has some needs and is on an IEP. That communication however is dijointed and not collaborative. I'll recieve communication from core teachers, specials, admin all at once fordifferent things and no one knows the other is contacting me. Needless to say it's a lot. Also my child is often sent to the office to calm down and recenter vs utilizing his accommodations. For a student who feels negatively about school to be sent to the office because staff rather take an easy out vs the time and resources to implement accommodations outlines in an IEP is not ok.   ",5,5,4,I'm hearing of cigarette and vaping issues in the upper grade. One child has seen vapes and cigarettes in the locker areas and in students backpacks,4,1,3,2,"there is no one that can convince me that our public schools are preparing our children for later in life. Perhaps it is happening more so at the HS level in our public school but my experience with my kids Fowler education is 100% stick to the state standards and teach to the test. The amount of BOY/MOY/EOY testing, state MCAS, etc is absolutely absurd. In between actual testing is teaching to the test. I do believe we have a good specials program, however I would much rather see that time reorganized and utilized for a full length recess for our middle schoolers. The behavior concerns and need for regimented supervision and behavior minimizing systems would likely be reduced if all grades had a full length recess and fresh air during the day. Our school literally sit on a national wildlife preserve. The trails and systems are accessible from all 3 of our districts school properties. NOT ONE of my children classes has ever utilized this as an opportunity to learn anything about this land, not the history of the land, the ecosystems, civic politics of land like this set aside, surveying, honoring and respecting the environment, etc. Not one thing. The reason is because it’s not in the state educational standards that our schools are mandated to spend what seems like 100% of the time teaching too. It's such a loss and just one example of a huge miss for our entire district. Another issue is the use of phones in classes. In middle school at least children are using their phones in class for whatever they want, including socials, games, etc. I hear of certain classes that this is allowed because they have finished their work. It sounds like it happens at the end of a bunch of classes when their work is done that they are either allowed to do this or they just do anyway. This seems like common place in health that there is literally no assignment for them (or perhaps they complete the work and there is nothing for them to so) so they are on their phones. Health is likely mandated, but this is a great example of a time and opportunity to get the kids OUTSIDE (for health and recreation…recess) instead of them being on their PHONES!!! ",3,3,3,4,"my kids are upper middle class white kids, I'm not so concerned that they are learning about learning about people simular to that. I am concerned about them learning about POC and social disparities and children of the world living in war zones, through famine, etc. are they, I'm not sure. I'm also not sure that they are learning about people simular to them in terms of disability and mental health struggles which would be more relevant to their experience and student populations at Fowler",1,,2,,2,,5,,2,,1,,"i think the teachers care a lot, but I think the system adn post-covid education implications are wearing down teachers A LOT and it is affecting how they feel about and do their jobs. Everyone is expected to do more with less. Our district is not level funding our schools and it is a problem. We have to let go of and move teachers around every year and this not only sucks for them but I know it is effecting students too. When we hire awesome teachers only to let them go because they were the most recent hires THAT SUCKS!!!! I think our district admin does a good job with what they have but its not without issue for all levels and it trickles down to the largest stakeholders...the students. I would really like to see our Fowler admin take a step back and again consider the largest stakeholder in the building, the students, and how to best implement programing that honors our shared investments in the school community and create ways that students learn to invest in respect and care for the building itself, their behaviors and their learning without making things run like a machine. One thing that wasn't brought up and I would like to mention is the absolutely awesome acceptance and support our LGBTQ+ students have at Fowler. Students appear to feel comfortable coming out, transitioning and living an authentic life without challenge or ridicule or whatever might happen more often in other places of less tolerance. It has appeared to be effortless and natural and easy for the school community to give live in and with acceptance of our LGBTQ+ students and staff and I love that that happens so seemingly effortlessly here.      "," questions about school incidents and how they are handled for example the various instances we have had this year with swastikas and anti whatever hate and what the school has done in response. Also we were asked questions about personal feelings of OUR own cultural representation in our families experiences at school, but I am not sure that there was an opportunity to answer how we feel the school does with these same questions regarding others in our communities ethnic, economic, social, gender, etc. diversity. AS a middle class white family my personal experience and answers for those questions would differ versus our thoughts and interpretation of how the district does with other more marginalized people in our community. I'd love to see questions regarding support for mental health, LGBTQ+ students, resources for families in need of access to social services and housing even,  "

We were both disappointed that Civics Action Projects, a new unique opportunity for students to pursue their own interests and research, were instead given to a class as a whole to complete through the library class. My student also would love to have speech and debate at school and science fair type activities. The computer science class, as with many specials, was very watered down and would have been a nice opportunity for enrichment but seemed to be a continuous repeat of old curriculum.",4,4,5,4,,1,,"2,4",,2,,6,,2,,1,,,"We have so many students leaving the district for charter schools. Parents have been bringing this up for many years and just a year or two ago Fowler and the high school started to offer open houses and describe their offerings at the same time charter schools are marketing to families. Having so many kids leave for charter schools is incredibly expensive for us, damages our community, and in many cases could be avoided. Students leave for both academic reasons and social. Why aren't we addressing students'  individual needs and differentiating more, offering more enrichment along with support."

And all of my interactions with staff and teacher's have been positive. One of the biggest challenges at Fowler is communication. Not that there isn't enough necessarily, but that it's spread ALL over the place. I get SMORES newsletters from the superintendent and from the principal about upcoming events or important dates. When I want to refer back to them I have to search my email for the right one. It would be SO much easier if there was a standard website link to a calendar and the link got sent out instead.   I'm also told to look for information about my child's assignments in various places such as Aspen or Google Classroom. There doesn't appear to be a consistent standard so I waste both my time and the poor teacher's time hunting and pecking until I find what I'm looking for OR I email to get more specifics. It would be great if the school could standardize on ONE platform and all teachers use the same platform in a consistent way. I think this would eliminate a lot of waste.  It makes it very difficult for me to follow along and support my child's academic progress.

I'm not sure what types of cultural competency training there is, but most still make assumptions about students being part of the dominant culture--not in mean or unkind ways, just in oblivious ways (e.g., ""imagine you had family members who died in the Holocaust""). I would like a bit more information from the guidance counselors on what they're doing with kids, but I know they are already overworked and understaffed so I hesitate to suggest it.

I would love to have my student doing some role playing for all kinds of situations: social situations, how to advocate for yourself with a peer and with an adult, etc. I know the faculty and staff are attentive to social issues.

For example, making sure they develop the habit of writing down homework in their school planner, making sure they are putting their homework and assignments into labeled folders. My student is extremely disorganized and could use this reinforcement. I also wish the school focused more on the process of learning and on authentic understanding. Grades become focal for students because they are THE summative assessment. I think students should be a part of parent, teacher, student conferences and have this be a time for feedback on academic progress. I also encourage the school to step back from using the computers for everything. Have kids learn to take notes by hand (obviously accommodating those students with diverse needs who would not be able to do this) which is more effective in helping them to digest and internalize material and is an important life skill. Some teachers reprimand students for taking notes which is insane to me. Also, it is generally better to do a count off (1, 2, 1, 2) instead of letting students group themselves into two teams. Our experience is that the teachers and staff really care about the students and want to do the best for them.

Provide a safe area scheduled with the guidance counselor where students can meet with their peers or have alone time to recharge and a quite space during lunch. Same as during the day. Include a wellness playground like the Curtis school in Sudbury.,3,4,3,My daughter has deal with difficult kids at school and she misses school sometimes to avoid the drama. ,3,4,4,3,"Fowler has good support but, it has a lot of mental health issues. An solution is to provide students with a designated safe and quite area for work and study area when they feel overwhelmed or facing challenging issues. Such as issues with peers or teachers. Students with ADHD have a low social battery and the general school classroom can be overwhelming at times. Also this includes students with other learning disabilities.

I also think it's time to have a change in administration such a new principal and teachers that have a stronger background in implementing wellness programs and handling difficult student behavior. The current administration at Fowler is not working. ",I did not see any questions on how the schools can best support the parents. Parents feel disconnected and lost at times with what their children are learning in school and what their goals are in each grade or classroom.
